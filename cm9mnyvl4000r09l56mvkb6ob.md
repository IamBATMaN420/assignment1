**Description:→ So, let me set up the context for this crash course or tutorial that will give you overall idea of following things like :→**

* Java (basic enough to start backend)
    
* Spring Boot
    
* Spring security
    
* Docker
    
* Microservice
    
* Kafka (for making microservice =» making the queue)
    
* Linux
    
* my SQL (as Database)
    
* AWS (deployment and cloud)
    
* React and React Native (very basic) =&gt;&gt;Frontend part
    
* JavaScript
    
* LLD (while designing multiple projects)
    
* HLD
    

and many more but this is good enough introduction and here Ig I am hooking you enough to start the journey and if this is not good enough to hook you in this tutorial then my friend just see some of some LinkedIn job posting all are filled up these keywords.

Well you can see this type of content very often the reason is the whole **Youtube community’s** focus is on the **MERN technology .** T**h**e reason behind it is simple enough making the MERN project is relatively easy and according to me it’s very overhyped but good enough for you .

If you want to witness and learn along the to this crash course cum long form tutorial with me. It will be a journey for approximately **30–60 days i.e. 2 month… and maybe You will take around 6 month to complete it.** I hope, You are as in as excited as me to start the journey.

### **Disclaimer :**

> *So, while seeing the content this is not any kind off pirated content but though the* **set of topics may can match** *because there are many course or project video that cattery this but no course has covering these kind of cutting edge technologies but* **content is completely different and extensive and completely based on my opinion and my understanding about these information only.**

> *Though the course include* **Javascript** , **React** *and* **even React Native** *but the amount will be very low. I have included this just to add* **backend** *and* **frontend** *in the whole course just to understand and see the* **Full stack** *overview.*

So, now let me cover some FAQS for you guys then let’s start :-

### FAQ

> Who can watch the course ?

If you have prior experience with **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, **C, C++ ,C#** or **even any programing language**, then it would be easy for you if have know basics on any of this language but it’s **not mandatory** for you to do it. But if you have prior experience It will be extremely helpful.

> *I have to experience with programming* can I follow along this course?

Yes, if you are beginner then you can follow-up you don't need anything extras. Just be curious and motivate enough to finish it and do hands on coding with me. That's more than enough the reason is it’s a beginner friendly guide.
