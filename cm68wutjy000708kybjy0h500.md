From its 10-day creation marathon to becoming the backbone of the internet, JavaScript has had a journey as dynamic as its syntax! In this blog, we’ll uncover the quirky, dramatic, and game-changing history of JavaScript—from its humble beginnings at Netscape to ruling the modern web. Expect plot twists, rivalries, and the evolution of a language that went from ‘just a browser script’ to a full-stack powerhouse. Buckle up for a time-traveling adventure through the wild world of JavaScript

![Netscape Navigator - Download](https://images.sftcdn.net/images/t_app-icon-m/p/577c0e58-9a61-11e6-992c-00163ed833e7/826461489/netscape-NETscape.png align="center")

## 0&gt; Netscape Navigator :→

so all the js strory begin from here it was a browser of 90’s that occupied 90% of market share.

---

## 1&gt; Static website :

In 90’s time website were mostly made with “HTML” , “CSS” only… then “Netscape” founder think to make a website that that will be made for browser only.. Then JS was made in 10 days. 🦇

And We need to learn it around 3 month. And he made it in 10 days.😂😂 so now let’s talk about it.

---

## 2&gt; MOCHA → JS :

so when 1st “JAVASCRIPT” was made it was named as “MOCHA” and after that it name was changed to

“LIVESCRIPT” and after that we get the name we are using “JAVASCRIPT”.

---

## 3&gt; Internet explorer :

so after “NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR “ came with “JS”, Microsoft also thinks to bring same language like this…

so they reverse engineer the language and take the same property and change a bit and make new language as “JSCRIPT”.

back then it was called taking “inspiration” not “piracy” ☠️☠️

## 4&gt; Involvement of ECMA :

**ECMA : European Computer Manufacturers Association**

So, it optimized “JavaScript” as fix some standard that if a language have this this that qualities. Then It will named as “JAVASCRIPT”.

**why is it important ?**

every browser was trying to make “JAVASCRIPT” for their browser that can make more and alot new confusion that’s to standardize things “ECMA” came forward and fix this.

## 5&gt; Into chrome engine :→ V8 engine

when chrome came in the picture that become very popular to make js more efficient they made their own engine to run js named it “**V8 engine**“. but though It was only meant for browser purpose.

---

## 6&gt; V8 to node :→

V8 was always meant for browser but NODE js was made by extracting V8 from chrome and mix some c++ and optimize it and by that “NODE” was made. It was a runtime environment.

---

## 7&gt; Is JS compiled or interpreted ?

so prvsly js was made <mark>interpreted(LINE BY LINE)</mark> but now it’s <mark>JIT (just in time)</mark>….not <mark>compiled( make a Separated file and then execute).</mark>

## 8&gt; Interpreted vs JIT compiler

JIT compiler → machine code → BYTE code

Interpreted → BYTE code (direct)

---

JavaScript was in console dev take that and google devs make v8 engine out of it and from there node was made ... then they made bun and deno etc...

BTS:-&gt; of code of console.log("hello world!")

a&gt; code file -&gt; parsing (see the key word like console and log) -&gt;

make tree like structure \[before code run\] -&gt;

JIT compiler -&gt;

byte code ( before machine code) -&gt;

machine code. -&gt; code execute!

Jit compiler make it more fast

here is a pictorial representation that may help
