## module-1: what is React? (ui framework ‚ùå ui libary ‚úÖ).

React is a JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (UI). UI is built from small units like buttons, text, and images. React lets you combine them into reusable, nestable *components.* From web sites to phone apps, everything on the screen can be broken down into components. In this chapter, you‚Äôll learn to create, customize, and conditionally display React components. (from offical react website)

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library that aims to make building user interfaces based on components more "seamless". It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.

### pic of Reconciliation:‚Üí

In React is the process the framework uses to efficiently update the user interface. When changes occur in a React application, React compares the current virtual DOM with the updated virtual DOM to determine the minimal changes needed to apply to the actual DOM. This process allows React to update only the necessary parts of the UI, improving performance by reducing the number of DOM manipulations.

## module-2: jsx,props,components.

### jsx:‚Üí

JSX (JavaScript XML) is **<mark>an extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like markup in JavaScript files</mark>**. It's often used with the React framework.¬†

in jsx or react the js code write by <mark>‚Äú { } ‚Äù</mark>

```javascript
function app(){
  return (
    <>
      <h1>hello world</h1>
      <b>congratulations</b>
    </>
  )
  
}
export default app;
```

### components:‚Üí

React components are the building blocks of React applications, serving as reusable and independent units of code that render specific parts of the user interface. They can be broadly categorized into function components and class components.

let‚Äôs make a card compents.

### props:‚Üí
